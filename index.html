    <h2>~Snakes~</h2>

    <p2
      >My favorite animal is the snake. I really like all the variety in their
      color, size, patern etc. because it makes them unique. Moreover, I seem to
      be drawn to their unsuality and 'creepy' nature. Although, I find them to
      be cute, rather then creepy. I also think the different adaptations and
      abilities of snakes are quite fascinating.

    <h2>~Writing~</h2>

    <p2>
      Writing is my favorite pastime. I enjoy writing fictitious stories. I like
      to use written media to express my stories because I think it is the
      easiest and most accessible medium to do so. I also find writing relaxing
      and usually write in the evening as a way to unwind. Furthermore, I
      believe writing is a good creative outlet.

    <h2>~The Owl House ~</h2>

    <p3> The Owl House is my favorite animated series. Do you enjoy... </p3>

    <ul>
      <li>Adventures?</li>
      <li>Magic systems/Witches?</li>
      <li>Fantasy worlds?</li>
      <li>Horror comedies?</li>
      ...then I believe you too would enjoy the Owl House.
    </ul>

    <p3>
      The series is based around the adventures of Luz Noceda
      <i> (the Human pictured)</i>, Eda Clawthorne
      <i>(the Witch pictured)</i> and co. as they do odd tasks around the
      Boiling Isles. This ultimately culminates in a quest to save the Isles
      from destruction.
    </p3>

    <p2>
      I find the animation style to be quite nice and the story intriguing and
      suspenseful. I also like most of the characters, which made me enjoy the
      series more overall, even with the slower paced episodes.
